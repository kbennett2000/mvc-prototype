# Screenshots needed

Every documentation page that references a screenshot links to a file under `docs/screenshots/` that doesn't exist yet. This page tracks all of them so a single capture pass can produce them.

**How to use this list:**

1. Set up a test version of the site with seed data.
2. Capture each screenshot at 1280×720 minimum, PNG format.
3. Save to the exact path shown.
4. Commit and push — the docs will reference them automatically.

> **Tip:** Use a fresh test GitHub account (not your personal one) for the editor-track captures so faces and real emails aren't shown.

## Marketing (used in README)

| Path | What to capture |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/screenshots/marketing/homepage.png` | Wide shot of the live site homepage — hero with the church exterior photo, service time visible, "Plan Your Visit" CTA. Mobile-first composition but desktop crop. |
| `docs/screenshots/marketing/cms-dashboard.png` | The TinaCMS dashboard at `/admin/index.html` showing the collections sidebar (Sermons, Announcements, Ministries, Staff, etc.) and the main content area listing entries. |

## Editor track (`docs/for-editors/*`)

These are the highest-stakes screenshots — a church secretary will follow this track step by step. Each shot should match the action described in the surrounding step.

### TinaCloud setup (`06a-setup-tinacloud.md`)

These are the highest-priority captures in the tech-volunteer track right now — TinaCloud was the #1 quit point in the adoption audit, and the doc is currently text-only. Until these exist, the doc relies on prose descriptions of "look for a button labeled something like…" patterns.

Capture against the live `app.tina.io` UI as of the capture date. TinaCloud's UI evolves; if labels in the screenshots no longer match what a visitor sees, recapture rather than rewriting the doc — the prose is intentionally tolerant of UI drift.

| Path | Used in step | What to capture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/tinacloud-signin.png` | 06a-setup-tinacloud, Step 1 | `app.tina.io` landing page with the "Sign in with GitHub" button visible. |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/tinacloud-dashboard-empty.png` | 06a-setup-tinacloud, Step 1 | First-load TinaCloud dashboard for a brand-new account — empty project list and the prominent "Create New Project" call-to-action. |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/tinacloud-new-project-form.png` | 06a-setup-tinacloud, Steps 2-4 | The new-project wizard mid-flow, with the GitHub-repo dropdown, the branch selector showing `main`, and the framework selector showing Next.js. |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/tinacloud-project-overview.png` | 06a-setup-tinacloud, Step 5 | A new project's Overview screen with the Client ID / Project ID prominently displayed — that field should be the focal point of the crop. |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/tinacloud-token-generate.png` | 06a-setup-tinacloud, Step 6 | The Tokens (or API Keys) page with the dialog/panel that appears after generating a read-only token — the token value should be visibly displayed (blur or use a test project for capture so the real value doesn't leak). The "shown only once" warning text should be included if TinaCloud shows it. |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/tinacloud-vercel-envvars.png` | 06a-setup-tinacloud, Steps 8-9 | Vercel's Settings → Environment Variables page after both `NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID` and `TINA_TOKEN` have been added — both shown in the list with the Sensitive indicator visible. Mask the actual values. |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/tinacloud-vercel-redeploy.png` | 06a-setup-tinacloud, Step 10 | The Vercel Deployments tab with the three-dot menu open on the most recent deployment, and the Redeploy confirmation dialog with the "Use existing Build Cache" checkbox visible (unchecked). |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/tinacloud-admin-signin.png` | 06a-setup-tinacloud, Step 11 | The TinaCloud sign-in screen as seen at `your-site.vercel.app/admin/` — the branded "Sign in with GitHub" page that appears once the env vars are wired correctly. |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/tinacloud-admin-collections.png` | 06a-setup-tinacloud, Step 11 | The TinaCMS interface after a successful sign-in — left sidebar showing collections (Site Settings, Sermons, Staff, etc.), main panel showing whichever collection is open first. This overlaps with the existing `marketing/cms-dashboard.png` capture; one good shot covers both uses. |

### Operational runbooks (`runbook-*.md`)

These runbooks are intentionally text-only for v1 because they're read under stress, when reading-tolerance is lowest. Good screenshots here are *high* impact — a glance at "this is what a failed deploy looks like" anchors the entire decision tree. Capture only when the matching UI is in the right state (you may need to deliberately break a staging deploy to capture a failure state).

| Path | Used in | What to capture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/runbook-vercel-deployments-ready.png` | runbook-site-down, Check 2 | Vercel Deployments list with the most recent deployment showing **Ready** (green checkmark) — the healthy state to compare against. |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/runbook-vercel-deployments-failed.png` | runbook-site-down, Check 2 | Vercel Deployments list with a recent deployment showing **Error**/**Failed** (red) — the symptom state. |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/runbook-vercel-promote-menu.png` | runbook-site-down, "Fastest fix is rollback" | The **⋯** menu open on a Ready deployment in the Deployments list, showing the **Promote to Production** option highlighted. This is the most-referenced screenshot across all three runbooks. |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/runbook-vercel-build-logs.png` | runbook-site-down, Check 2 | A failed-deploy detail view with the build log scrolled to show a typical "last error" — a Module not found or env-var error works well as an exemplar. |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/runbook-vercel-runtime-logs.png` | runbook-site-down, Check 4 + runbook-emails-stopped, Check 2 | The **Runtime Logs** tab on a deployment, with filters visible (so the reader knows where to filter by route path). |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/runbook-browser-devtools-network.png` | runbook-site-down, Check 4 | Browser DevTools Network tab with the first request highlighted and its status code visible. Either a 200 or 500 is fine; the goal is showing the reader where to look. |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/runbook-vercel-crons-list.png` | runbook-emails-stopped, Check 2 | Vercel project Settings → Cron Jobs (or Crons) page showing both `/api/cron/devotionals` and `/api/cron/digest` with their hourly schedule and last-invocation timestamps. |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/runbook-resend-logs.png` | runbook-emails-stopped, Check 4 | Resend dashboard Logs view filtered to the last 24 hours, showing a mix of `delivered`, `bounced`, and (ideally) a `failed` with the error reason visible. |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/runbook-resend-api-keys.png` | runbook-emails-stopped, Check 5 + runbook-rotate-secret (RESEND_API_KEY) | Resend API Keys page with at least one key listed, the **Create API Key** button visible, and the per-key **⋯** menu hint (rotation pattern). |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/runbook-drizzle-studio-subscribers.png` | runbook-emails-stopped, Check 1 | Drizzle Studio with the `subscribers` table open, showing the columns (id, email, status, tags, etc.) so the reader knows what to look at. Use seed data with redacted emails. |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/runbook-vercel-env-vars.png` | runbook-rotate-secret (multiple sections) + runbook-emails-stopped, Check 3 | Vercel Settings → Environment Variables page with several vars listed (`RESEND_API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `CRON_SECRET`, etc.) and the Edit menu visible on one of them. Mask actual values. |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/runbook-vercel-redeploy-dialog.png` | runbook-rotate-secret (all sections) | The Redeploy confirmation dialog with the "Use existing Build Cache" checkbox visible and unchecked — referenced from every rotation procedure. |
| `docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/runbook-dnschecker-resolved.png` | runbook-site-down, Check 3 | A dnschecker.org result page showing the user's domain resolving to a Vercel IP with green checkmarks across regions — the healthy state. |

## Developer track (`docs/for-developers/*`)

No screenshots needed — these are reference docs with code excerpts rather than UI walkthroughs.

## Capture checklist

When recording, use:

- Browser zoom at 110-125% so text is readable when scaled down in docs.
- Light theme, default GitHub appearance.
- Window width ~1280px (consistent across shots).
- Crop tight to the relevant area — full-page screenshots are usually too big.
- Annotate clicks with a circle or arrow in red — Skitch, Cleanshot, or any markup tool works.

After capture, run `git status` to confirm the path matches one in the table above. The docs should then render the image without further changes.
