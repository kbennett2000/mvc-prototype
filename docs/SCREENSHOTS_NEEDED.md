# Screenshots needed

Every documentation page that references a screenshot links to a file under `docs/screenshots/` that doesn't exist yet. This page tracks all of them so a single capture pass can produce them.

**How to use this list:**

1. Set up a test version of the site with seed data.
2. Capture each screenshot at 1280×720 minimum, PNG format.
3. Save to the exact path shown.
4. Commit and push — the docs will reference them automatically.

> **Tip:** Use a fresh test GitHub account (not your personal one) for the editor-track captures so faces and real emails aren't shown.

## Marketing (used in README)

## Developer track (`docs/for-developers/*`)

No screenshots needed — these are reference docs with code excerpts rather than UI walkthroughs.

## Capture checklist

When recording, use:

- Browser zoom at 110-125% so text is readable when scaled down in docs.
- Light theme, default GitHub appearance.
- Window width ~1280px (consistent across shots).
- Crop tight to the relevant area — full-page screenshots are usually too big.
- Annotate clicks with a circle or arrow in red — Skitch, Cleanshot, or any markup tool works.

After capture, run `git status` to confirm the path matches one in the table above. The docs should then render the image without further changes.
