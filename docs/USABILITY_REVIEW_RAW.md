## docs/for-editors/01-getting-started.md

- **Line 12 — jargon-undefined:** "A free GitHub account" — she's never heard of GitHub. The doc later says "GitHub is a free service that stores the website's files," but that's not until step 2, and the prerequisites list hits her first.
- **Line 13 — jargon-undefined:** "to invite you to the church's GitHub" — invite her how? To what? She'd picture an email invitation but not understand what she's joining.
- **Line 14 — assumed-knowledge:** "The web address of your church's site, with `/admin/` on the end" — she may not understand why you'd add `/admin/` and might worry she's not "allowed" to go there.
- **Line 16 — missing-context:** "the tech volunteer at your church has to add your GitHub username to the website" — she doesn't yet know what a GitHub username is or where to find hers.
- **Line 20 — jargon-undefined:** "**CMS** (Content Management System...)" — fine, defined inline; good pattern. (good)
- **Line 26 — ambiguous-step:** "**Type** your church's web address followed by `/admin/`" — she might literally type "yourchurch.org/admin/" because the example uses that placeholder.
- **Line 44 — assumed-knowledge:** "Your username is how other people on the team will recognize you — use something like `jane-smith` or `jsmith-mvc`" — she might wonder what characters are allowed, whether to use her real name, and whether punctuation/uppercase matters.
- **Line 52 — ambiguous-step:** "My GitHub username is `@jane-smith`" — she may not know where to find her username on GitHub once she's signed up.
- **Line 58 — jargon-undefined:** "Decap (the editor)" — first time "Decap" appears without explanation. She'll wonder if Decap is something separate from "the editor."
- **Line 66 — missing-context:** "GitHub's authorization screen" — she has no idea what authorization means or what she's agreeing to. Brief reassurance would help.
- **Line 84 — jargon-undefined:** "**Collections** (categories of things you can edit)" — defined inline. (good)
- **Line 95 — jargon-undefined:** "**Workflow**. That's where drafts and changes waiting for review show up" — "drafts" and "waiting for review" are new concepts not yet introduced.
- **Line 117 — assumed-knowledge:** "open an issue: [GitHub Issues]" — she has no idea what "opening an issue" means, and the link looks technical and intimidating.

## docs/for-editors/02-add-a-sermon.md

- **Line 75 — missing-context:** "This is the part most people get stuck on, so go slowly." — Good framing. (good)
- **Line 79 — assumed-knowledge:** "**Look** at the address bar. The URL looks like one of these:" — She knows what a URL is, but might not have the YouTube video open, or might not realize the "address bar" is the same on YouTube as on any site.
- **Line 85 — ambiguous-step:** "The **Video ID** is the 11-character code after `v=` (or after `youtu.be/`, or after `/live/`)." — Counting characters and finding "after `v=`" assumes she can parse URL parameters. The example screenshot helps; without it she'd likely give up.
- **Line 109 — missing-context:** "(Don't worry that it says 'image' — Decap reuses the same picker for files.)" — Nice acknowledgment but the word "Decap" might confuse — earlier docs called this "the editor."
- **Line 129 — ambiguous-step:** "Pick a wide photo (about twice as wide as it is tall — for example, 1600 by 900 pixels)" — She may not know how to find or determine a photo's dimensions before uploading.
- **Line 149 — assumed-knowledge:** "**Click** the **Status: Draft** dropdown at the top of the form." — Status concept introduced abruptly; "dropdown" she knows from forms, fine.
- **Line 169 — jargon-undefined:** "Series names are case- and spelling-sensitive" — "case-sensitive" is a technical term she may not know.
- **Line 180 — assumed-knowledge:** "open an issue: [GitHub Issues]" — repeated across docs; she still doesn't know what this means.

## docs/for-editors/03-edit-a-page.md

- **Line 39 — jargon-undefined:** "**Story** field is a WYSIWYG editor — 'What You See Is What You Get.'" — defined inline. (good)
- **Line 45 — assumed-knowledge:** "(or press Ctrl+B on Windows, Cmd+B on Mac)" — She'll know one of these from Word — likely OK.
- **Line 47 — jargon-undefined:** "Don't use **Heading 1** — that's reserved for the page title." — "reserved for" is vague; she may not understand why or what would happen if she did.
- **Line 83 — give-up-risk:** "There's also a small text-mode toggle for editors who want to write in Markdown (a simple text-with-symbols format). Don't worry about this — the toolbar handles everything for you." — Multiple unfamiliar terms (text-mode toggle, Markdown, "text-with-symbols") even though it says don't worry; the warning may itself cause uncertainty.
- **Line 109 — assumed-knowledge:** "Try pasting with Ctrl+Shift+V (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+V (Mac) — this pastes as plain text." — She might not know what plain text means in this context, but the keyboard shortcut is followable.
- **Line 119 — assumed-knowledge:** "open an issue: [GitHub Issues]" — repeat issue.

## docs/for-editors/04-add-a-staff-member.md

- **Line 15 — ambiguous-step:** "A square headshot photo (about 800 by 800 pixels works best)" — She may not know how to determine a photo's pixel dimensions before clicking upload.
- **Line 68 — missing-context:** "Set Display Order (this is the tricky one)" — Good warning. (good)
- **Line 87 — assumed-knowledge:** "Give the new person `2.5` — fractional numbers work fine." — Conceptually clever, but she might worry "is that wrong, won't 2.5 break something?"
- **Line 155 — assumed-knowledge:** "open an issue: [GitHub Issues]" — repeat issue.

## docs/for-editors/05-update-service-times.md

- **Line 68 — ambiguous-step:** "Address — street, city, state (two letters), ZIP code." — Unclear if these are separate fields or one. She'll find out, but a screenshot or "you'll see four fields" would help.
- **Line 101 — assumed-knowledge:** "your browser cached the old version. Refresh the page with Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)." — "Cached" not defined. The instruction is followable, but if it doesn't work she has no fallback.
- **Line 111 — assumed-knowledge:** "open an issue: [GitHub Issues]" — repeat issue.

## docs/for-editors/06-add-an-event.md

- **Line 51 — missing-context:** "**Internal ID** is a short nickname for the event in the system" — She might not understand why it needs to be lowercase with hyphens. Examples help, but the constraint is computer-y.
- **Line 62 — assumed-knowledge:** "Once you publish an event, don't change its Internal ID later. If you do, links and RSVPs tied to it can break." — "Links and RSVPs tied to it" is hand-wavy; she'd want concrete reassurance.
- **Line 99 — give-up-risk:** "`weekly` — for events that happen every week on the same day. / `nth-of-month` — for events like 'the second Saturday of every month.' / `last-of-month` — for events like 'the last Sunday of every month.'" — The hyphenated lowercase values (`nth-of-month`, `last-of-month`) look code-like and unfamiliar. She'd worry she's "supposed to type that exactly."
- **Line 107 — ambiguous-step:** "**Type** a number in the **Day of Week** field" — using 0-6 to represent days is unintuitive; the doc warns "Sunday is `0`, that's a computer thing" but she may still misremember and pick wrong.
- **Line 120 — missing-context:** "The numbering starts at zero — that's a computer thing." — Honest, but doesn't reassure her; she may worry she'll mess this up.
- **Line 222 — assumed-knowledge:** "open an issue: [GitHub Issues]" — repeat issue.

## docs/for-editors/07-upload-photos.md

- **Line 21 — jargon-undefined:** "1200 pixels wide on the long edge" — "long edge" may be unclear; she'd interpret "1200 pixels" as a unit she's heard of but never measured.
- **Line 22 — assumed-knowledge:** "under 2 megabytes (MB). Huge files make the site slow." — She knows MB roughly from email attachments. OK.
- **Line 29 — assumed-knowledge:** "1920 × 1080 pixels — Wide rectangle (16:9)" — "16:9" ratio terminology is technical; the "wide rectangle" plain-language label helps.
- **Line 40 — jargon-undefined:** "**JPG** (also called JPEG)" — fine, but next line: "Smaller files, faster pages." — clear.
- **Line 41 — jargon-undefined:** "**PNG** — for logos, screenshots, or anything with sharp edges or transparent backgrounds." — "transparent background" may be unfamiliar.
- **Line 52 — assumed-knowledge:** "**Windows:** Open the photo in **Paint** or **Photos**, choose **Resize**, change the width, save." — She likely uses Photos; OK. But specifics of "change the width" without saying which value to enter could trip her up.
- **Line 56 — assumed-knowledge:** "[squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app/) — drag a photo in, drag the slider to shrink it, download the smaller version." — "Drag a photo in" assumes drag-and-drop familiarity.
- **Line 104 — missing-context:** "Every photo you upload is stored in the website's `images/uploads/` folder." — She wouldn't recognize this as a path; harmless but mildly unsettling.
- **Line 112 — jargon-undefined:** "Decap won't overwrite a file with the same name" — "Decap" mentioned again without re-explaining.
- **Line 123 — assumed-knowledge:** "open an issue: [GitHub Issues]" — repeat issue.

## docs/for-editors/08-publishing-changes.md

- **Line 19 — jargon-undefined:** "sends your change to GitHub as a 'change ticket' (a pull request)." — Defined inline. (good)
- **Line 26 — assumed-knowledge:** The ASCII flow diagram — she'd see "boxes and arrows" but might find it more confusing than helpful.
- **Line 45 — jargon-undefined:** "**commit** — a snapshot of what you changed" — defined inline. (good)
- **Line 47 — jargon-undefined:** "GitHub opens a **pull request** — think of it as a 'please merge this change' ticket." — defined inline. (good)
- **Line 50 — missing-context:** "'Commit,' 'pull request,' 'merge' — these are all GitHub words. You don't need to know them." — Good reassurance. (good)
- **Line 57 — jargon-undefined:** "**In Review** — you've marked it Ready for Review and clicked Publish." — Reasonably introduced.
- **Line 110 — missing-context:** "The old version is preserved in GitHub's history — nothing is ever truly lost" — Reassuring. (good)
- **Line 133 — assumed-knowledge:** "open an issue: [GitHub Issues]" — repeat issue.

## docs/for-editors/glossary.md

- **Line 41 — assumed-knowledge:** "Clicking **Publish → Publish now** sends your change to a tech volunteer for a quick review." — Glossary entries are written with implicit context. The arrow `→` notation isn't explained — she'd interpret it as "then click," which is correct, but isn't obvious.
- **Line 47 — jargon-undefined:** "It's stored on a service called GitHub." — Fine.
- **Line 87 — jargon-undefined:** "**Markdown** — A simple way to write formatted text using symbols instead of buttons — for example, `**bold**` for **bold** or `# Heading` for a heading." — Defined, but the asterisks-as-formatting concept may confuse her even with the explanation.
- **Line 105 — assumed-knowledge:** "open an issue: [GitHub Issues]" — repeat issue.

## docs/for-editors/troubleshooting.md

- **Line 21 — jargon-undefined:** "GitHub repository (the website's filing cabinet)" — defined inline. (good)
- **Line 33 — ambiguous-step:** "ask your tech volunteer to confirm they added the username spelled exactly as it appears on your GitHub profile page (at `github.com/yourusername`)" — She may not know how to find her own GitHub profile page; the URL with `yourusername` could be read literally.
- **Line 35 — assumed-knowledge:** "Cookies cleared, or you logged out of GitHub between sessions." — "Cookies" and "session" are technical terms.
- **Line 39 — assumed-knowledge:** "Pop-up blocker is hiding the GitHub login window." — "Pop-up blocker" she might know vaguely; the fix is okay.
- **Line 41 — assumed-knowledge:** "Check the address bar for a small 'pop-up blocked' icon. **Click** it and **allow** pop-ups from the church's site" — Specific enough she could try; depends on browser.
- **Line 109 — assumed-knowledge:** "Your GitHub login expired, or someone changed your access permissions while you were working." — "Expired login" is jargon she'd vaguely understand.
- **Line 191 — assumed-knowledge:** "The URL of the editor page you were on." — Clear instruction.
- **Line 202 — assumed-knowledge:** "open an issue: [GitHub Issues]" — repeat issue.

## docs/for-tech-volunteers/01-overview.md

(Note: this section is for "semi-technical" people, but persona still flagged.)

- **Line 8 — missing-context:** "The semi-technical person at the church" — She might read this thinking "is that me?" and quickly conclude no, but at least the audience is signaled.
- **Line 20 — jargon-undefined:** "powered by Next.js" — Undefined; she'd ignore but it adds friction.
- **Line 22 — jargon-undefined:** "Decap CMS" — first appearance.
- **Line 33 — give-up-risk:** "Install Node.js and Git (or use Codespaces, no install)" — Three unfamiliar terms in one cell of a table: Node.js, Git, Codespaces. She'd close the doc.
- **Line 38 — jargon-undefined:** "set up CMS authentication" — undefined.
- **Line 50 — jargon-undefined:** "live website at a `*.vercel.app` URL" — `*.vercel.app` is unfamiliar pattern.
- **Line 52 — jargon-undefined:** "A **GitHub repository** that stores all the website's content."
- **Line 63 — give-up-risk:** "Node.js is the engine that builds and previews the site on your computer. Git is the version-control tool that talks to GitHub. **Or** you can skip both by using GitHub Codespaces, which runs everything in your browser." — Three concepts back-to-back; would overwhelm.
- **Line 65 — jargon-undefined:** "**Fork the repository** — You copy the template to your own GitHub account so you can customize it." — Defined inline. (good)
- **Line 73 — give-up-risk:** "Point `yourchurch.org` at Vercel by adding two DNS records at your domain registrar (the place you bought the domain)." — DNS, records, registrar all hit at once.
- **Line 75 — jargon-undefined:** "set up the Decap authentication so they can log in" — undefined.
- **Line 89 — jargon-undefined:** "username and password at GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, or wherever the domain is registered" — She'd know GoDaddy maybe; "domain registered" concept fuzzy.
- **Line 96 — assumed-knowledge:** "A database — there isn't one. All content is stored as files in GitHub." — Reassuring, but mentioning a database is itself confusing.

## docs/for-tech-volunteers/02-prerequisites.md

- **Line 20 — give-up-risk:** "**Path A (recommended): GitHub Codespaces — no install**" — She'd want this option but doesn't know what Codespaces is yet.
- **Line 22 — jargon-undefined:** "It runs the whole development environment in your browser." — "development environment" is jargon.
- **Line 31 — assumed-knowledge:** "Codespaces gives you Node.js and Git built in." — Even bypassing install, she'd worry she's missing something.
- **Line 42 — jargon-undefined:** "Node.js is the engine that runs the setup script and builds the website. You need version 18 or newer." — "Engine," "setup script," "version 18" — multiple terms.
- **Line 48 — ambiguous-step:** "**Click** the big green **LTS** button on the homepage. ('LTS' means 'Long-Term Support' — the stable version.)" — Inline explanation helps. (good)
- **Line 56 — assumed-knowledge:** "**Click** **Next** through each screen, accepting the defaults." — Familiar pattern from Windows installers — OK.
- **Line 66 — give-up-risk:** "**Open** a terminal:" — She has never opened a terminal; the instruction "Press the Windows key, type `cmd`, press Enter. A black window opens." is followable but the appearance of a black command window would alarm her.
- **Line 72 — give-up-risk:** "**Type** this command and press Enter: `node --version`" — Cliff: she's now typing commands. Two unfamiliar terms (terminal, command) and a syntax (`--`) that looks alien.
- **Line 76 — ambiguous-step:** "If the version starts with `v18`, `v20`, `v22`, or higher, you're good." — Familiar pattern, but she'd need to literally compare numbers.
- **Line 78 — assumed-knowledge:** "If you see 'command not found' or 'is not recognized,' Node.js didn't install correctly." — She'd assume something was broken.
- **Line 91 — ambiguous-step:** "**Click** **64-bit Git for Windows Setup** (the most common option)." — "64-bit" is undefined; she might not know what to pick.
- **Line 96 — ambiguous-step:** "The installer asks a lot of questions about line endings and editors; **accept every default**." — "Line endings" is opaque; "accept every default" is good reassurance.
- **Line 114 — jargon-undefined:** "**Command Line Developer Tools**" — undefined.
- **Line 119 — give-up-risk:** "Use your package manager:" + bash commands `sudo apt install git` — Total cliff. "Package manager," "sudo," "apt" all unknown.
- **Line 146 — give-up-risk:** "git config --global user.name 'Your Name'" — She'd need to literally type these, with quotes, and the `--global` flag looks alien.
- **Line 152 — missing-context:** "You won't see any output. That's normal — Git silently saved the settings." — Good reassurance. (good)
- **Line 159 — jargon-undefined:** "a code editor" — "Visual Studio Code" she'd Google.
- **Line 170 — give-up-risk:** "Mac terminal asks for an 'Xcode license.' Type `sudo xcodebuild -license` and follow the prompts." — Multiple unknowns; she'd give up.
- **Line 171 — jargon-undefined:** "'Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style' works for this project" — pure jargon.

## docs/for-tech-volunteers/03-fork-and-clone.md

- **Line 18 — jargon-undefined:** "A **fork** is GitHub's word for 'make my own copy of someone else's repository.'" — Defined inline. (good)
- **Line 33 — ambiguous-step:** "The URL looks like `https://github.com/your-org/your-repo` (replace with the actual template URL when published)." — "your-org/your-repo" is placeholder she'd type literally.
- **Line 45 — jargon-undefined:** "Leave it as your personal GitHub account, or pick a GitHub Organization if the church has one." — "Organization" undefined; she'd not know.
- **Line 51 — jargon-undefined:** "**Leave** the **Copy the main branch only** checkbox checked." — "branch" undefined.
- **Line 67 — give-up-risk:** "Codespaces runs the project in your browser. No install needed." — Reassuring, but the next steps still expect terminal familiarity.
- **Line 88 — assumed-knowledge:** "A new browser tab opens with a loading screen. After about 60 seconds, you'll see a full code editor in your browser with a terminal at the bottom." — She's never seen a "code editor"; the appearance would be intimidating.
- **Line 91 — ambiguous-step:** "If the welcome message doesn't show, **click** in the terminal area at the bottom of the screen." — She wouldn't know which area is "the terminal."
- **Line 109 — give-up-risk:** "**Click** the small **copy** icon next to the HTTPS URL. The URL looks like `https://github.com/your-username/church-site.git`." — `.git` suffix unfamiliar; "HTTPS URL" vs SSH not explained.
- **Line 121 — ambiguous-step:** "By default, your terminal starts in your home folder. To put the project on your desktop: `cd Desktop`" — `cd` command unknown to her.
- **Line 134 — give-up-risk:** "`git clone https://github.com/your-username/church-site.git`" — She'd type "your-username" literally.
- **Line 141 — assumed-knowledge:** Output snippet "remote: Enumerating objects: 1234, done." — Total gibberish, but only used to confirm success.
- **Line 153 — ambiguous-step:** "`cd church-site`" — She wouldn't know that this is "entering" a folder.
- **Line 163 — jargon-undefined:** "If you installed VS Code: `code .`" — `code .` looks bizarre.
- **Line 174 — give-up-risk:** "`git clone` says 'Permission denied (publickey).' You copied an SSH URL instead of HTTPS." — SSH, public key, HTTPS — pile of unknowns.

## docs/for-tech-volunteers/04-first-time-setup.md

- **Line 22 — jargon-undefined:** "Installs the project's software dependencies (about 100 packages — runs once)." — "Dependencies," "packages" undefined.
- **Line 26 — jargon-undefined:** "Writes those answers into `content/site.json` and `app/globals.css`." — File paths and `.json`/`.css` extensions unfamiliar.
- **Line 41 — give-up-risk:** "In your terminal, type: `ls`" — Two-letter command, unfamiliar.
- **Line 44 — assumed-knowledge:** "(On Windows native command prompt, use `dir` instead of `ls`.)" — Adds branching complexity.
- **Line 46 — assumed-knowledge:** "You should now see a list of files and folders including `package.json`, `content`, `app`, and `scripts`." — She'd see a list but wouldn't know what those mean.
- **Line 52 — give-up-risk:** "`npm run setup`" — "npm" is alien; she would have hit it many times now.
- **Line 76 — missing-context:** "Don't interrupt this step. If the install gets cut off halfway, the project won't work and you'll have to delete `node_modules/` and re-run setup." — Recoverable, but mentions `node_modules/` ominously.
- **Line 100 — assumed-knowledge:** "**Short name / acronym:** The 2-3 letter version used inside the placeholder logo. The script auto-suggests one based on the church name's initials." — Clear once read.
- **Line 148 — give-up-risk:** "`npm run start`" — Another alien command.
- **Line 162 — ambiguous-step:** "**Open** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser." — "localhost" undefined; she'd worry "isn't a website on the internet?"
- **Line 166 — jargon-undefined:** "**Codespaces note:** In Codespaces, the URL is different — VS Code in the browser shows a small popup... Or click the **Ports** tab in the bottom panel and click the globe icon next to port 3000." — "Ports tab," "port 3000" full jargon.
- **Line 170 — assumed-knowledge:** "press **Ctrl+C** to stop the running site." — She knows Ctrl+C as copy; might be confused.

- **Line 192 — jargon-undefined:** "'npm: command not found.' Node.js isn't installed correctly." — Persona would think the whole project broke.

## docs/for-tech-volunteers/05-customize-branding.md

- **Line 13 — jargon-undefined:** "logo as an image file (PNG or SVG, ideally with a transparent background)" — "SVG" undefined here.
- **Line 14 — jargon-undefined:** "Hex codes or names for the church's official brand colors." — "Hex codes" undefined.
- **Line 25 — assumed-knowledge:** "the setup script generated a basic logo using the church's initials and dropped it at `public/logo.svg`" — file path; she'd not know how to find it.
- **Line 33 — jargon-undefined:** "**PNG** with a transparent background, OR **SVG** (better — scales perfectly to any size)." — "Transparent background" and "scales perfectly" partially understandable.
- **Line 35 — assumed-knowledge:** "[Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) — free browser-based option." — Suggested but she wouldn't know how to use it.
- **Line 41 — give-up-risk:** "In Codespaces or VS Code, you can drag-and-drop the file from your desktop into the `public/` folder in the file tree." — "File tree" undefined; she may not even know where files live in VS Code.

- **Line 53 — give-up-risk:** "The four palettes are starting points. To match your church's exact brand colors, edit the CSS variables in `app/globals.css`." — CSS, variables, file path — multiple cliffs.
- **Line 56 — give-up-risk:** "The site uses **semantic color tokens** — names like `primary`, `accent`, and `background` instead of specific hex codes." — "Semantic color tokens," "hex codes" all unknown.
- **Line 60 — give-up-risk:** "The variables are HSL values (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)." — Mathematical color theory.
- **Line 62 — give-up-risk:** "`--primary: 120 14% 32%;`" — CSS syntax that looks like nonsense.
- **Line 69 — jargon-undefined:** "**Hue** (0-360)" — explained but the persona would struggle.
- **Line 78 — assumed-knowledge:** "[hslpicker.com](https://hslpicker.com/) — drag, get HSL." — Too terse.

- **Line 128 — assumed-knowledge:** "Don't put hex codes (`#ff0000`) directly into `globals.css`. Stick with HSL triplets" — Now she's expected to know two color systems.

- **Line 150 — give-up-risk:** "Near the top of the file, you'll find the font imports. They look like this: `import { Inter, Fraunces } from 'next/font/google';`" — JavaScript/TypeScript code to be edited — she's deep in code now.
- **Line 187 — give-up-risk:** "`<html lang='en' className={`${inter.variable} ${lora.variable}`}>`" — Backticks, JSX, dollar braces; she'd have no idea what to change.

## docs/for-tech-volunteers/06-deploy-to-vercel.md

- **Line 8 — jargon-undefined:** "publish the site to the internet" — fine.

- **Line 120 — assumed-knowledge:** Big config list with "Framework Preset," "Build Command: `next build`," "Output Directory," etc. — Reassuring "don't change anything," but list itself is intimidating.

- **Line 175 — assumed-knowledge:** "**In** your project's dashboard, **click** **Settings** → **Domains**." — Clear once in Vercel UI.
- **Line 197 — give-up-risk:** "Run `git status` — if it lists modified files, run `git add .`, `git commit -m 'Updates'`, `git push`." — Stack of git commands again.
