# Content model

**Who this is for:** Developers who need to know exactly what shape each content type has on disk, in TypeScript, and in the CMS config.
**What you'll accomplish:** Understand the data model end-to-end so you can extend it without breaking sync between TinaCMS and TypeScript.
**You'll need first:**
- Familiarity with the project layout. See [architecture.md](./architecture.md).

---

## The three-way coupling

For each content type, three places must stay in sync:

1. **TinaCMS config** — `tina/config.ts` declares the collections and fields editors fill in.
2. **TypeScript type** — `lib/<type>.ts` defines the runtime shape (type-only file).
3. **Loader function** — `content/<type>.ts`, reads files from `content/<type>/` (or imports the matching `.json`).

If you add a field in `tina/config.ts`, you must also add it to the TypeScript type and (if relevant) handle it in the loader. TinaCMS will happily write a field that the loader ignores — but downstream components won't see it.

> **Note:** The TypeScript signatures below are illustrative — they describe the shape but may simplify field optionality. The canonical source of truth is the `lib/<type>.ts` file; verify against it when extending.

## Sermon

**On disk:** `/content/sermons/*.md`

Each file is Markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: "The Weight of a Quiet Faithfulness"
date: "2026-01-12"
speaker: "Pastor John Smith"
series: "Walking Through Ruth"
scripture: "Ruth 2:1-23"
book: "Ruth"
youtubeId: "dQw4w9WgXcQ"
audioUrl: "#"
notesUrl: "#"
thumbnail: "/images/uploads/sermon-ruth-2.jpg"
---

Boaz steps onto the page as a picture of faithful, quiet kindness.
```

**TypeScript type** — `lib/sermons.ts` (type only):

```ts
export type Sermon = {
  id: string;            // derived from filename
  title: string;
  date: string;          // ISO date string, "YYYY-MM-DD"
  speaker: string;
  series: string;
  scripture: string;
  book: string;
  youtubeId: string;
  audioUrl: string;
  notesUrl: string;
  thumbnail: string;
  description: string;   // the markdown body after frontmatter
};
```

**Loader** — `content/sermons.ts` exports `getAllSermons()`, `getLatestSermon()`, `getSermon(id)`. Function exports (not top-level `const`) so CMS edits hot-reload in dev — see [architecture.md](./architecture.md#loader-pattern) for the rationale.

**TinaCMS config** — `tina/config.ts`, collection `sermons`.

**Where consumed:**
- `app/watch/page.tsx` — sermon archive grid.
- `app/watch/[id]/page.tsx` — single sermon view with embedded video and prev/next navigation.
- `components/sections/latest-sermon.tsx` — featured most-recent sermon on the homepage.

**ID:** TinaCMS generates filenames using the `slugify` function in `tina/config.ts` — for sermons this produces `YYYY-MM-DD-title-slug.md`. The loader uses the filename (minus `.md`) as `id`, and the dynamic route is `app/watch/[id]/page.tsx`.

## Ministry

**On disk:** `/content/ministries/*.md`

```markdown
---
title: "MVC Kids"
slug: "kids"
tagline: "A safe, fun place for kids to learn about Jesus."
description: "Children's ministry on Sunday mornings during service."
image: "/images/imported/mvc-kids-hero.jpg"
whoFor: "Newborn through 5th grade"
meetings:
  - day: "Sundays"
    time: "9:00 AM"
    location: "MVC Kids Wing"
    note: "During service"
whatToExpect:
  - "Bible-based teaching"
  - "Snack and play time"
leader:
  name: "Mary Whittaker"
  role: "Children's Ministry Coordinator"
  email: "mary@mvckiowa.com"
  photo: "/images/uploads/mary-whittaker.jpg"
gallery:
  - "/images/uploads/kids-1.jpg"
  - "/images/uploads/kids-2.jpg"
---

Optional long-form description in markdown.
```

**TypeScript type** — `lib/ministries.ts`:

```ts
export interface Meeting {
  day: string;
  time: string;
  location: string;
  note?: string;
}

export interface MinistryLeader {
  name?: string;
  role?: string;
  email?: string;
  photo?: string;
}

export interface Ministry {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  tagline: string;
  description: string;
  image: string;
  whoFor?: string;
  meetings?: Meeting[];
  whatToExpect?: string[];
  leader?: MinistryLeader;
  gallery?: string[];
  body?: string;
}
```

**TinaCMS config** — `tina/config.ts`, collection `ministries`.

**Where consumed:**
- `app/ministries/page.tsx` — index of all ministries.
- `app/ministries/[slug]/page.tsx` — individual ministry pages, generated via `generateStaticParams`.
- `components/sections/ministries-grid.tsx` — homepage grid.

**Slug:** Set explicitly via the `slug` field. The filename also matches but the field is what gets used for routing.

## "Our Story" page

**On disk:** `/content/story.md`

```markdown
---
title: "Our Story"
---

# Our Story

We began as a handful of families gathering in a living room in 1968...

## Where we are today

...
```

**TypeScript type:**

```ts
export interface StoryPage {
  title: string;
  body: string;    // raw markdown body
}
```

A loader (TBD per [REFACTOR_FOR_TEMPLATE.md](../REFACTOR_FOR_TEMPLATE.md)) will parse this on the about page. Currently the about page has its own JSX prose; the markdown source exists as the canonical version for migration.

## Adding a new field to an existing type

The cookbook in four steps:

1. **Edit** `tina/config.ts` — find the collection in `defineConfig({ schema: { collections: [...] } })` and add the field object to the `fields` array. Include `type`, `name`, and `label`. See [adding-a-cms-collection.md](./adding-a-cms-collection.md) for the field type reference.
2. **Edit** `lib/<type>.ts` — add the field to the TypeScript interface. Make it optional (`?:`) if existing content files won't have it yet.
3. **Update** the loader if any transformation is needed (often nothing — `gray-matter` exposes frontmatter as a plain object).
4. **Consume** the new field in a page or component.

Test locally with `npm run build` to catch type errors before pushing.
