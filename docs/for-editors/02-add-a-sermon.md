# Add a sermon

**Who this is for:** Whoever is responsible for posting the Sunday sermon to the website each week.
**What you'll accomplish:** Add a complete sermon entry — title, speaker, video, and description — and publish it.
**You'll need first:**
- Logged in to the editor at `/admin/`. See [Getting started](./01-getting-started.md).
- The sermon's YouTube link (if you've uploaded the video).
- The sermon's title, speaker name, date, and Scripture reference.
- (Optional) The MP3 audio file URL, sermon notes PDF, and a thumbnail image.

## Steps

### 1. Open the Sermons collection

**Click** **Sermons** in the left sidebar.

You should now see a list of all past sermons, newest first.

![Sermons collection list](/docs/screenshots/editor/add-a-sermon-list.png)

### 2. Click New Sermon

**Click** the **New Sermon** button in the top right of the sermon list.

You should now see a blank sermon form with empty fields.

![New sermon form](/docs/screenshots/editor/add-a-sermon-new-form.png)

### 3. Fill in Sermon Title

**Type** the title the pastor gave the sermon. For example: `The Weight of a Quiet Faithfulness`.

This is the headline visitors see on the sermon card and on the "latest sermon" section of the homepage.

### 4. Pick Date Preached

**Click** the calendar icon next to **Date Preached**.

**Select** the Sunday this sermon was preached.

> **Warning:** Don't type the date by hand. Always use the date picker — it stores the date in the format the website needs.

### 5. Fill in Speaker

**Type** the speaker's full name. For example: `Pastor John Smith`.

For guest speakers, use whatever name they'd want printed.

### 6. Fill in Series

**Type** the sermon series name. For example: `Walking Through Ruth`.

If this sermon isn't part of a series, **type** `Standalone Messages` (or leave the default, which is already set to that).

### 7. Fill in Scripture Reference

**Type** the passage. For example: `Ruth 2:1-23` or `Matthew 5:1-12`.

Use a hyphen for the verse range. Use a colon between chapter and verse.

### 8. Fill in Book of the Bible

**Type** just the book name. For example: `Ruth` or `Matthew` or `Psalms`.

> **Tip:** Visitors can filter sermons by book on the watch page, so spelling matters. Use the standard Bible book name (not abbreviations like "Mt" or "Matt").

### 9. Find and paste the YouTube Video ID

This is the part most people get stuck on, so go slowly.

**Open** the sermon's YouTube video in a new tab.

**Look** at the address bar. The URL looks like one of these:

- `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`
- `https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ`
- `https://www.youtube.com/live/dQw4w9WgXcQ?feature=share`

The **Video ID** is the 11-character code after `v=` (or after `youtu.be/`, or after `/live/`).

In all three examples above, the ID is `dQw4w9WgXcQ`.

**Copy** just that ID (not the whole URL).

**Paste** it into the **YouTube Video ID** field in the editor.

![YouTube URL with ID highlighted](/docs/screenshots/editor/add-a-sermon-youtube-id.png)

> **Common Mistake:** People paste the full URL (`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`) instead of just the ID. If the embedded video doesn't appear on the published page, this is almost always why. Edit the sermon and paste just the 11-character ID.

If the video hasn't been uploaded yet, **leave** this field blank. You can come back and fill it in later.

### 10. Fill in Audio File URL (optional)

If you have a direct link to an MP3 of the sermon, **paste** it into **Audio File URL**.

If you don't, **leave** the default `#` in the field. The audio player will be hidden on the sermon page until a real URL is added.

### 11. Upload Sermon Notes PDF (optional)

If the pastor wrote sermon notes as a PDF:

**Click** the upload button next to **Notes URL**.

**Click** **Upload** at the top of the picker window.

**Select** the PDF from your computer.

**Click** **Choose Selected** at the bottom right.

You should now see the filename next to the field.

If there are no notes, leave the field as-is.

### 12. Upload a Thumbnail Image (optional)

A thumbnail is a picture that shows up on the sermon card. If you skip this, the site uses a default sanctuary photo.

**Click** the **Choose an image** button next to **Thumbnail Image**.

**Click** **Upload**.

**Pick** a wide photo (about twice as wide as it is tall — for example, 1600 by 900 pixels). See [Upload photos](./07-upload-photos.md) for what makes a good image.

**Click** **Choose Selected**.

### 13. Fill in Description

**Type** one or two sentences that describe what the sermon is about. This shows up underneath the title on the sermon card.

For example: *"Boaz steps onto the page as a picture of faithful, quiet kindness — and a glimpse of the Redeemer to come."*

### 14. Save

**Click** the **Save** button at the top of the form.

TinaCMS commits the new sermon directly to the site. The change goes live after Vercel rebuilds (1–3 minutes). You'll see the sermon appear on the Watch page after that.

That's it — you're done.

## Common Mistakes

- **The embedded video doesn't show up after publishing.** You pasted the whole URL instead of just the 11-character ID. Edit the sermon, fix the **YouTube Video ID** field, and publish the fix.
- **The date is wrong on the published page.** You typed the date instead of using the date picker. Edit and re-pick the date using the calendar.
- **The sermon doesn't appear under the right series.** Series names are case- and spelling-sensitive. `Walking Through Ruth` and `walking through ruth` are treated as different series. Be consistent.
- **The sermon isn't showing up yet.** The site takes 1–3 minutes to rebuild after you save. Refresh the Watch page after a few minutes.

## Stuck?

- [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) — common problems and fixes.
- **Ask your church's tech volunteer.** They can sit next to you, share screens, or look over the problem with you. This is your fastest path to help.
- If you'd rather report something in writing: [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/issues) (this is the tech-volunteer route — your tech volunteer can help you do it if needed).
