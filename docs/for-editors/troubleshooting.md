# Editor troubleshooting

**Who this is for:** Editors who hit a snag and need a quick fix without calling the tech volunteer.
**What you'll accomplish:** Solve the most common problems editors run into, ordered by what people ask about most.
**You'll need first:** Nothing — this is a reference. Skim until you find your symptom.

> **Tip:** Can't find your problem here? Email your tech volunteer with three things: (1) what you were trying to do, (2) what happened instead, (3) a screenshot if you can. That's enough for them to help.

## "I can't log in"

### Symptom: "Not authorized" after I click Login with GitHub

**Cause:** Your GitHub username hasn't been added to the church's GitHub repository (the website's filing cabinet) yet. Or, you were added but didn't accept the email invitation.

**Fix:**
1. **Open** your email and look for a message from GitHub titled something like "You've been invited to..."
2. **Click** the **View invitation** link inside.
3. **Click** **Accept invitation** on the GitHub page.
4. **Go back** to the editor and try logging in again.

If you can't find the invitation email, ask your tech volunteer to confirm they added the username spelled exactly as it appears on your GitHub profile page (at `github.com/yourusername`).

### Symptom: GitHub asks me to authorize the church site every time I log in

**Cause:** Cookies cleared, or you logged out of GitHub between sessions.

**Fix:** Click **Authorize** — it's safe. The editor needs permission to read and write the church's files, and that permission is per-browser-session by design.

### Symptom: The login button does nothing when I click it

**Cause:** Pop-up blocker is hiding the GitHub login window.

**Fix:** Check the address bar for a small "pop-up blocked" icon. **Click** it and **allow** pop-ups from the church's site, then try Login with GitHub again.

## "I uploaded a photo and it looks weird"

### Symptom: The photo is blurry on the live site

**Cause:** Original photo was too small (under 1200 pixels wide).

**Fix:** Find a higher-resolution version and re-upload. See [Upload photos](./07-upload-photos.md) for recommended sizes.

### Symptom: A staff member's portrait is cropped weirdly — half their face is gone

**Cause:** The photo isn't square. Staff portraits are cropped to a circle, which only looks right with a roughly square photo.

**Fix:**
1. **Crop** the original photo to a square (focus on the face) using your computer's photo editor.
2. **Re-upload** through the staff entry.

### Symptom: Photo takes forever to upload, or fails

**Cause:** File is too big (over 5 MB).

**Fix:** Shrink the file at [squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app/) and try again.

### Symptom: Wrong photo on the published page

**Cause:** You picked the wrong photo from the media picker (easy to do when filenames look alike).

**Fix:** Open the entry, click the photo field, pick the right one from the picker, save, and republish.

## "I clicked Publish but my change isn't live"

This is by far the most common question. See the dedicated section in [Publishing changes](./08-publishing-changes.md) — it walks through every possible cause. The short version:

1. **The tech volunteer hasn't approved it yet.** Check the **Workflow** tab. Text them if urgent.
2. **The site is still rebuilding.** Wait 2-3 minutes.
3. **Your browser is showing a cached version.** Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) to force a fresh load.
4. **You clicked Save but not Publish.** Change the status to **Ready for Review** and publish.

---

## "I deleted something by mistake"

### Symptom: I clicked Delete on a sermon (or staff member, etc.) and it's gone

**Don't panic.** Nothing is ever truly gone in this system. Two paths back:

**If you hadn't yet published the deletion:**
1. **Click** **Workflow** at the top right.
2. **Find** the deletion entry under In Review.
3. **Click** it and either edit it back or discard it.

**If the deletion is already live:**
1. **Re-create** the entry by clicking **New Sermon** (or whatever it was) and filling in the original fields.
2. **Or**, ask your tech volunteer to restore it from history (they can do this with one command).

> **Tip:** If you remember the date and title of what you deleted, your tech volunteer can pull the exact original back from GitHub in seconds.

## "Decap says I'm not authorized" mid-session

### Symptom: I was working fine, then suddenly got an "unauthorized" error

**Cause:** Your GitHub login expired, or someone changed your access permissions while you were working.

**Fix:**
1. **Click** the user-avatar dropdown at the top right of the editor.
2. **Click** **Log out**.
3. **Log back in** with Login with GitHub.

If that doesn't work, your access may have been removed by mistake. Email the tech volunteer.

## "I don't see a Publish button"

### Symptom: I edited an entry but the Publish button is greyed out or missing

**Cause:** You have unsaved changes, or the editor is still saving.

**Fix:**
1. **Click** the **Save** button first.
2. **Wait** a few seconds for it to finish saving.
3. **Change** the status to **Ready for Review**.
4. **Publish** button should now be active.

---

## "Save button doesn't do anything"

### Symptom: Click Save, nothing happens, no confirmation

**Cause:** Most likely a required field is empty.

**Fix:** Scroll through the form looking for a red highlight or a small error message under any field. Fill in the required field, then save.

---

## "I can't find an entry I created"

### Symptom: I added a sermon yesterday, but it's not in the Sermons list

**Cause:** Most likely it's still a draft and hasn't been published.

**Fix:** **Click** **Workflow** at the top right. Drafts and pending changes live there, not in the main collection list.

---

## "Service time / phone number / address didn't update on the homepage"

### Symptom: I changed the service time in Site Settings, but the homepage still shows the old time

**Causes (in order of likelihood):**

1. **The change hasn't been merged yet.** Check the **Workflow** tab.
2. **The site is still rebuilding.** Wait 2-3 minutes.
3. **Your browser is showing the cached version.** Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac).
4. **You edited the wrong field.** Some pages have headlines that mention the time as part of a sentence — those are edited separately. Double-check the **Sunday Service** section in Site Settings.

---

## "I get a 'conflict' message when I try to save"

### Symptom: The editor says my changes conflict with someone else's

**Cause:** Someone else edited the same entry while you had it open.

**Fix:**
1. **Click** **Discard** to throw away your changes.
2. **Re-open** the entry — it'll show the other person's latest version.
3. **Re-apply** your edits on top.
4. **Save** and publish.

> **Tip:** For shared content (Site Settings, in particular), it's a good idea to coordinate with other editors so you're not both editing at the same time.

---

## "Something else is broken"

Email or text your tech volunteer. Include:

- What you were trying to do.
- What happened instead.
- A screenshot if you can take one.
- The URL of the editor page you were on.

That's enough for them to help.

## What's next?

- [Getting started](./01-getting-started.md) — refresher on the basics.
- [Publishing changes](./08-publishing-changes.md) — understand the publish flow.
- [Glossary](./glossary.md) — definitions of the technical-sounding words.

## Stuck?

- **Ask your church's tech volunteer.** They can sit next to you, share screens, or look over the problem with you. This is your fastest path to help.
- If you'd rather report something in writing: [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/issues) (this is the tech-volunteer route — your tech volunteer can help you do it if needed).
