# Prerequisites

**Who this is for:** Tech volunteers about to set up the template for the first time.
**What you'll accomplish:** Have everything installed (or pick the no-install Codespaces path) so you can start setup.
**You'll need first:**
- An internet connection.
- About 1 GB of free disk space (if you choose the install path).

---

## Two paths — pick one

### Path A (recommended): GitHub Codespaces — no install

If you'd rather not install software on your computer, **use Codespaces**. It runs the whole development environment in your browser.

**Pros:**
- Zero install. Works from any computer with a browser.
- The same setup every time (no "works on my machine" issues).
- Free for 60 hours/month — more than enough for setup and maintenance.

**Cons:**
- Requires an internet connection.
- Slightly slower than running locally.

**Skip the rest of this page and go to [Fork and clone](./03-fork-and-clone.md).** Codespaces gives you Node.js and Git built in.

### Path B: Install Node.js and Git on your computer

If you'd rather run everything locally, install the two tools below.

---

## Install Node.js

Node.js is the engine that runs the setup script and builds the website. You need version 18 or newer.

### Steps for Windows or Mac

1. **Open** [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download) in your browser.

2. **Click** the big green **LTS** button on the homepage. ("LTS" means "Long-Term Support" — the stable version.)

3. **Save** the installer file to your Downloads folder.

4. **Open** the installer.

5. **Click** **Next** through each screen, accepting the defaults.

6. **Click** **Install**. You may need to enter your computer's password.

7. **Click** **Finish** when done.

   You should now see Node.js installed in your Start menu (Windows) or Applications (Mac), but you won't use it through a graphical app — you'll use it through the terminal.

### Verify Node.js is installed

**Open** a terminal:
- **Windows:** Press the Windows key, type `cmd`, and press Enter. A black window opens.
- **Mac:** Press Cmd+Space, type `Terminal`, and press Enter. A white window opens.

**Type** this command and press Enter:

```
node --version
```

You should now see something like `v20.10.0` printed on the next line. If the version starts with `v18`, `v20`, `v22`, or higher, you're good.

If you see "command not found" or "is not recognized," Node.js didn't install correctly. Try the installer again, or see [troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md).

## Install Git

Git is the tool that downloads the template code and uploads your changes to GitHub.

### Steps for Windows

1. **Open** [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

2. **Click** **64-bit Git for Windows Setup** (the most common option).

   ![Git for Windows download](/docs/screenshots/tech-volunteer/prerequisites-git-windows-download.png)

3. **Open** the downloaded installer.

4. **Click** **Next** on each screen — every default is fine. The installer asks a lot of questions about line endings and editors; **accept every default**.

5. **Click** **Install** at the end.

6. **Click** **Finish**.

### Steps for Mac

1. **Open** a terminal (Cmd+Space, type `Terminal`, press Enter).

2. **Type** this command and press Enter:

   ```
   git --version
   ```

3. If Git is already installed, you'll see a version like `git version 2.43.0` and you're done.

   If it's not installed, macOS will pop up a dialog offering to install the **Command Line Developer Tools**. **Click** **Install**. It takes 5-10 minutes.

4. Once installed, re-run `git --version` to verify.

### Steps for Linux

Use your package manager:

```
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install git

# Fedora
sudo dnf install git
```

### Verify Git is installed

In your terminal:

```
git --version
```

You should now see something like `git version 2.43.0`.

## Configure Git (one-time)

Tell Git who you are. In your terminal:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

Use the same email as your GitHub account.

You won't see any output. That's normal — Git silently saved the settings.

---

## (Optional) Install a code editor

You can edit text files in any program, but a code editor makes it easier. Recommended:

- **Visual Studio Code** (free): [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Install with the defaults.

---

## Common Mistakes

- **`node --version` says "command not found" after install.** Close your terminal window and open a new one — the new terminal picks up the updated PATH.
- **Mac terminal asks for an "Xcode license."** Type `sudo xcodebuild -license` and follow the prompts. This happens once after installing the developer tools.
- **Git installer asked about line endings — I just clicked Next.** That's fine. The default ("Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style") works for this project.

## What's next?

- [Fork and clone](./03-fork-and-clone.md) — copy the template to your GitHub account.

## Stuck?

- [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) — common install problems.
- Open an issue: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/issues)
