This will walk you through getting your church site online — for free,
on Vercel.com. You'll do the clicking in your web browser; this terminal
just tells you what to do next.

Time needed: about 15 minutes
Cost: $0 (Vercel has a generous free tier for small sites)

${c.bold}You'll need:${c.reset}
  • A GitHub account (free)
  • A Vercel account (free, you can sign up with GitHub)
  • Your site already set up (you ran ${c.bold}npm run setup${c.reset})
`);

  ${c.bold}Do this:${c.reset}
    a. Open ${c.cyan}https://github.com/signup${c.reset} in your browser
    b. Sign up (just an email and password)

  ${c.dim}If you already have a GitHub account, skip this step.${c.reset}`

  await step(

  ${c.bold}Do this:${c.reset}
    a. Open ${c.cyan}https://github.com/new${c.reset}
    b. Repository name: ${c.bold}church-site${c.reset} (or whatever you'd like)
    c. Keep it ${c.bold}Private${c.reset} (recommended)
    d. ${c.bold}Don't${c.reset} check any of the "Add a README" / .gitignore boxes
    e. Click ${c.bold}Create repository${c.reset}

  After clicking, you'll see a page with setup instructions.
  ${c.bold}Keep that page open${c.reset} — you'll need the URL from it in Step 3.`

  ${c.dim}On Mac/Linux you can also use the GitHub Desktop app (github-desktop.com)${c.reset}
  ${c.dim}to do this without a terminal.${c.reset}`

  framework/build settings exactly as they are.`

    a. Scroll to the bottom of the import page
    b. Click ${c.bold}${c.green}Deploy${c.reset}

  Vercel will build your site (this takes 1-3 minutes).
  When it finishes, you'll see a celebration page with a URL like:

    ${c.cyan}https://church-site-xyz.vercel.app${c.reset}

    b. Type your domain and click ${c.bold}Add${c.reset}
    c. Vercel shows DNS records to set at your domain registrar
       (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.)
    d. Add those records in your registrar's dashboard
    e. Wait 5-60 minutes for DNS to propagate

  ${c.dim}Don't have a domain yet? Vercel lets you buy one through them, or you${c.reset}
  ${c.dim}can buy from any registrar. Costs ~$10-15/year typically.${c.reset}`

${c.bold}What happens next:${c.reset}

  • Every time someone publishes a change in the CMS, Vercel
    rebuilds the site automatically — usually within 2 minutes.

  • To set up the CMS for editors, see ${c.cyan}docs/CMS_GUIDE.md${c.reset}
    (the "For the tech volunteer" section at the bottom).

  • Don't share your Vercel password. Do share the live URL.
